NOTE: All bounds on uncertainties are given with a 95.0% confidence interval. The number of runs was determined with a 0.1% tolerance.
For Base (Alternative 0) 100.0 Monte-Carlo simulations were run.
For Alt 1 (Alternative 1) 51200.0 Monte-Carlo simulations were run.
For Alt 2 (Alternative 2) 51200.0 Monte-Carlo simulations were run.
The random number seed for these runs was 406038800.
