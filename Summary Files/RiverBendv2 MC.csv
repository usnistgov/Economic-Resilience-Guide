NOTE: All bounds on uncertainties are given with a 95.0% confidence interval. The number of runs was determined with a 0.1% tolerance.
For Base (Alternative 0) 1000 Monte-Carlo simulations were run.
For Retrofit (Alternative 1) 18000 Monte-Carlo simulations were run.
For New Bridge (Alternative 2) 9000 Monte-Carlo simulations were run.
The random number seed for these runs was 70819614.
