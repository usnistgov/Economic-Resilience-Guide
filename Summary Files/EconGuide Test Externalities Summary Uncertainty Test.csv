Outputs of Economic Evaluation: [EconGuide Test 1]
NOTE: All bounds on uncertainties are given with a 95.0% confidence interval. The number of runs was determined with a 1e-07% tolerance.
For Base (Alternative 0) 100.0 Monte-Carlo simulations were run.
For Alt 1 (Alternative 1) 102400.0 Monte-Carlo simulations were run.
For Alt 2 (Alternative 2) 102400.0 Monte-Carlo simulations were run.
The random number seed for these runs was 951485170.
